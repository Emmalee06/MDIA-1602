Welcome to my repository for my *code* &lt;3

![Yummy ham n cheese](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18de1f63-33f3-410b-bfc8-b7b8c7c4bc06)



3 *Aha* moments: 
1. I learned git add, git status, git commit and git push!
2. When I realized why my README wasn't pushing!
3. Adding my stables.js file to git hub!

2 things that are *unclear*
1. Navigating to different files is still a bit weird, but not totally unclear
2. How to "tick" to highlight words like in the code?

1 word to describe how I'm feeling: 
- *Confident :D!*

'git clone' - copies a version of my repository
