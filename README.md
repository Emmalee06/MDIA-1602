3 *Aha* moments: 
1. I realized how to used the terminal
2. When Kass helped me with the directory in the terminal
3. Creating a README file

2 things that are *unclear*
1. How to go to a different folder in CD
2. CD is still a little unclear

1 word to describe how I'm feeling: 
- *overwhelmed T-T*

'git clone' - copies a version of my repository
