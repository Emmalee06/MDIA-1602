Week 06 - Updated Read Me! 

3 *confusing* things: 
1. What are the branches for? 
2. What does merging do exactly? 
3. Arrays *were* confusing, but I figured it out

3 things I *understand*
1. Indexes and arrays 
2. How to use if statements 
3. How to incorporate .length with my arrays

An *analogy* I use: 
- Think of arrays like a farm where all my animals (items) are stored in one barn (a declaration)
- A farm can have multiple barns, so my animals can be placed in different barns (different declarations)
